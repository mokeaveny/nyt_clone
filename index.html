					<p class="article_text">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
							physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s
							appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
							equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
																	particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
																	discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with.
																	A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could
																	have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
																	repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
																	of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
					</p>

					<p class="article_text">
					 If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
					 heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,
					 warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the
					 wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but
					 would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.

					 "SPECTACULAR REALIZATION," Dr.Guth wrote across the top of
					 the page and drew a double box around it.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers
					 reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that
				   his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					  Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic
					  time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led
					  by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
					  Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-
					  called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
					  wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
					  trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought
				    smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his
					  colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
					 many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
				   science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing 
					 the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast 
					 realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see,
					 extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of 
					 billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos 
					 whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, 
					 beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of 
					 other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta 
					 water boiling over.
					</p>

					<h2 class="article_subheading">'As Big as It Gets'</h2>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces 
					 operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
				   accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. 
					 Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
			     gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of 
					 general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					  Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-
					  universe expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge,
					  as big as it gets.”
					</p>
				 	<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, 
					 sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath
					 of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a
				   picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as 
					 the surface of the sun.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known 
					 as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic
			     Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the 
					 Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers 
					 submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.
