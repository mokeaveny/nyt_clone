					<p class="article_text">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
							physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s
							appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
							equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
																	particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
																	discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with.
																	A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could
																	have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
																	repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
																	of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
					 heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,
					 warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the
					 wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but
					 would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 "SPECTACULAR REALIZATION," Dr.Guth wrote across the top of
					 the page and drew a double box around it.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers
					 reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that
				   his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					  Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic
					  time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led
					  by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
					  Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-
					  called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
					  wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
					  trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought
				    smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his
					  colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
					 many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
				   science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing 
					 the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast 
					 realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see,
					 extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of 
					 billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos 
					 whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, 
					 beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of 
					 other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta 
					 water boiling over.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<h2 class="article_subheading">'As Big as It Gets'</h2>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces 
					 operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
				   accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. 
					 Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
			     gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of 
					 general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					  Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-
					  universe expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge,
					  as big as it gets.”
					</p>
				 	<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, 
					 sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath
					 of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a
				   picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as 
					 the surface of the sun.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known 
					 as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic
			     Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the 
					 Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers 
					 submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

					<p class="inflation_text">
					 Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the
					 instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

					<p class="article_text">
					 Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one 
					 in 10 million.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had
				   not expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have 
					  been lucky.”
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ 
					 worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a 
					 leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select
				   few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at 
					 Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who
				   was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as
					  scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he
					  tended his radio telescopes.

					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the
					 most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 
					 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week
					 when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s
					 team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell him the news.
					</p>
					<br><br>

					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 Confused, Dr.Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was
					  a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, but I
					  simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde
				    wrote in an email.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he
					 was still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of
					 spoiling a vacation,” he said.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
						By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that
				    inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists
					  responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think
					 that if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest
					 discoveries in the history of science.”
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor
				   and head of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope,
				   pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation
				   that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis,
					 said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he
					 expressed reservations about inflation.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized
					 the need for confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded
					 earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background
					 by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and
					 other assumptions about the universe.	
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
						Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft
					  will report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams
					  are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.

					 Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the
			     cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno
				   Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won
				   the Nobel Prize.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					 Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these
					 waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a
					 series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole,
					 where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The
					 others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie
					 Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
					</p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="article_text">
					“The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on
				   the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said,
				    wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.
