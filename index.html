					<p class="article_text">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
							physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s
							appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
							equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
					</p>

					<p class="article_text">He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
																	particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
																	discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with.
																	A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could
																	have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
																	repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
																	of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
